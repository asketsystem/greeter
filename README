Our goal for this project is to find a rhythm in how we go about building our 
application and discovering if we are on the right track. To help us there, 
we will adopt test driven development (TDD) for that

We wrote a deployment test that helped guide us through the initial migration needed
to get our contract onto the test network. This allowed our subsequent tests to inter‚Äê
act with the deployed contract.
Lastly, we started exploring the Solidity language and learned about the different
function visibility modifiers (external, public, internal, private). Those same
modifiers are also available for state variables (with the exception of external) used
in persisting data on the blockchain. We also implemented the concept of Ownable
and refactored to using the OpenZeppelin contract via inheritance
